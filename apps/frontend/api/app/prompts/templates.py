- Number IDs starting from 1
- Format dates preserving the original precision. Keep months when present: "Jan 2020 - Dec 2023", "May 2021 - Present". Use "YYYY - YYYY" only when the source has no months.
- Use snake_case for custom section keys (e.g., "volunteer_work", "publications")
- Preserve the original section name as a descriptive key
- Normalize date separators: "2020-2021" → "2020 - 2021", "Current"/"Ongoing" → "Present". Do NOT discard months.
